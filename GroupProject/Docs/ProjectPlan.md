**Author**: Youjung Kim (Team 44)

## 1 Introduction
Word Scramble is a life long enjoyable game application which offers creating and sharing a scramble, solving Word Scrambles, and reviewing statistics. This Project Plan documents how the team will create the application for the customer.

## 2 Process Description
### 2.1 Identify requirements
* Description : This activity is to fully understand functional requirements of the Word Scramble project. The team will observe and review the requirements using the Five Ws and How technique. A requirement can appear or can be removed into the beginning of the construction phase. Therefore, the Requirement Lead will create the first draft Use Case Diagram with functional requirements and every team member will update the diagram as there are changes to requirements.
* Entrance criteria : Major users and Real needs of the project; Main identified risks 
* Exit criteria: Project definition; Initial use case diagram; Functional Requirement list; Initial Component Diagram

### 2.2 Perform analysis and create design
* Description: This activiy includes multiple steps to create and refine the design and architecture of the software. The team will analyze the problem domain to gain a better understanding. Through the analysis, the design will be created in Class Diagram. Prototypes will be defined during the process of creating the Class Diagram. A solid architectural foundation will be determined per the functional requirements and represented in the Component Diagam. The design lead will be in charge of completing the document and all team members will assist with their functional area. Risk management is a big portion of this activity as well. The team will identify major risks and try to eliminate them. Otherwise, all risks will be mitigated to a lower level.
* Entrance criteria: Initial use case diagram; Functional Requirement list; Initial Component Diagram
* Exit criteria: Completed Use Case Diagram; Completed Component Diagram; Class Diagram; GUI Mockup

### 2.3 Implement the design and Integrate into a product
* Description: This activity is a shift in emphasis from intellectual property development to product development. The most of the actual development occurs in this activity. The ideas and design will be actualized in a product on all the integrated platforms. Throughout this process, the Project Manager will review, inspect, and discuss progress of the implementation and status within the team. The Integration Process is to systematically assemble the higher level product from the subsystems that each team member developed. This ensures that the product, as integrated, functions properly at all subsystems and across all interfaces. Progress should be documented within the technical schedules. Peer reviews, unit testing, code inspections and other techniques may be used to assure the coded product is ready for the verification process. 
* Entrance criteria : Use Case Diagram; Component Diagram; Class Diagram; GUI Mockup 
* Exit criteria: Use Case Diagram with traceability information; Beta release software product; Completed Unit Test Result; Use Case Diagram; Component Diagram; Class Diagram;GUI Mockup; Source code
 
### 2.4 Verify code with testing plan
* Description:  This activity is the verification and validation processes conducted on the realized end product. All subsystems will be thoroughly tested as they are implemented using Unit Test technique(JUnit) and Integration Testing will be performed. The end product will be evaluated by the Product Verification Process. For the verification process, the Test lead will manage the following four major steps: (1) create a test plan; (2) conduct the tests; (3) analyze the test results; and (4) resolve any problems discovered prior to delivery of the product. Possible methods for software verification include use of simulations, black box and white box testing techniques, and analyses of requirement implementation.
* Entrance criteria : Beta version product;
* Exit criteria: Testing Result; User manual; Product Verification Result 

### 2.5 Deploy the product
* Description: The final software product will be deployed and the end product will be installed and used by the customers. Training, customer service, and providing help-line assistance may be required. All the documents from analysis to deployment  will be finalized.
* Entrance criteria :Beta release product; Product verification result
* Exit criteria: End product; User mannual


## 3 Team
| Name | Role | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Brian Greenwald | Test Lead | Test Lead is responsible for defining the scope of testing within the context of each release / delivery and implementing and evolving appropriate measurements and metrics. Performs planning and deploying the testing effort for any given release as well as managing Testing tools and processes.
| John Youngblood | Design Lead | Responsible for design and development of the software by creating high-level architectural specifications and addressing problems of systems integration and compatibility. Responsible for managing the conversion from concept to the multiple levels of designs. |
| Tamur Khan | Requirements/Development Lead | The primary responsibility is to elicit, analyze, validate, specify, verify, and manage the real needs of the project. Identify appropriate representatives for each user class and negotiate their responsibilities. Define quality attributes, external interfaces, constraints, and other nonfunctional requirements.|
| Youjung Kim | Project Manager | Responsible for defining the project, building comprehensive work plans to be shared with other staff members, and executing and closing projects. Also will track project performance, specifically to analyze the successful completion.|
| All | Developer |  Play a role in implementation of assigned portion referencing the functional and nonfunctional requirements, project plan, multiple designs, and test plan of the system. |
