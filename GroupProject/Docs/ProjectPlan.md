## 1 Introduction
Word Scramble is a life long enjoyable game application which offers creating and sharing a scramble, solving Word Scrambles and reviewing progress.

## 2 Process Description

*Process description as a set of activities; for each activity, provide the following:*
what you will do in this project, and they should be a reflection of a real-life project, as in the lessons.

- *Activity name (verb or verb phrase)*
- *Activity description (concise paragraph)*
- *Entrance criteria (inputs needed for the activity)*
- *Exit criteria (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)*

### 2-1. Identify requirements
* Description : This activity is to fully understand functional requirements of the Word Scramble project. We will observe and review the requirement using the Five Ws and How. As process going forward, a requirement can appear or can be removed into the beginning of the construction phase. Therefore, the Requirement Lead will create the first draft Use Case Diagram and every team member will update the diagram as there are changes to requirements.
* Entrance criteria : Major users and what system will do for them defined, Main risks identified
* Exit criteria: Stakeholder concurrence on scope, definition, and cost/schedule; Initial use case diagram; Functional Requirement list; Initial Architecture Diagram

### 2-2. Perform analysis and create design
* Description: This activiy includes mutliple steps to create and refine the design and architecture of the software. The team will analyze the problem domain to gain a better understanding. Through the analysis, the design will be created in two forms: Class Diagram for the static component and Sequence Diagram for the dynamic component. The design lead will be in charge of completing the document and every team member will follow up. 

Risk management is big portion of this activity. As we writing up the how we implement the application, we should try to find the ay to elminate the major risk 
Per functional requirement 
* Entrance criteria: Intial risk management
* Exit criteria: Almost complete use-case model; Refined Software Architecture; Lower Level Desgign Model; Test Cases; Highest risk elements eliminated;
Tentative architecture diagram

### 2-3. Implement the design
* Description: 
* Entrance criteria : Class diagram 
* Exit criteria: Set of software components
### 2-4. Verify code with testing plan
* Description: 
* Entrance criteria : Class diagram, Set of software components
* Exit criteria: Testing Result
### 2-5. Deploy the product
* Description: 
* Entrance criteria : Class diagram, Set of software components
* Exit criteria: Product
